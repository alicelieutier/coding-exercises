## Coding exercises

Some coding exercises I created for my own tutoring practice.

There are a number of *writing* code questions, but I also include some *reading* and *fixing* code, as well as reading documentation to interact with code, as I think this type of exercise teaches a different skillset. 

Feel free to reuse them.

If you work on some of these, let me know!
